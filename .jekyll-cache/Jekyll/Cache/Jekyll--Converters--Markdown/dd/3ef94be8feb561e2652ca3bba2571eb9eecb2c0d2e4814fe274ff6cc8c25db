<p>Hi there.</p>

<p>We are TheReviewIndex.</p>

<p>We thought reading reviews, on sites like Amazon, is a bit too tedious. Most products have hundreds, even thousands of reviews. Itâ€™s impossible to make sense of that many reviews, let alone compare across products.</p>

<p>So we built <a href="https://thereviewindex.com">The Review Index</a> that uses Neural Networks to detect and quantify recurring patterns in reviews, enabling one to go through thousands of reviews in a few minutes.</p>

<p>Also - we call out products with significant volumes of spam / fake reviews so that one doesnâ€™t end up trusting them.</p>

<p>We recently launched a public beta for Amazon (US) electronic / gadget / appliance reviews, and are iterating over the website and algorithms. We will expand to include other marketplaces soon.</p>

<p>There is a lot of data waiting to be churned and presented - stay tuned!</p>

<p>Â </p>
